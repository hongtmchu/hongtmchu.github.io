<p class="text-justify">
Computational approaches to optimal transport and Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problems. I specialize in designing fast computational methods and efficient algorithms to solve these problems, particularly in the context of robust machine learning and deep neural networks. A key part of my research involves analyzing tractable regularization techniques and their distributionally robust interpretations.
